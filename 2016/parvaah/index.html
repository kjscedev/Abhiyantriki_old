                <p class="lead">
                    Parvaah, is the social initiative of K. J. Somaiya College of Engineering. It is inspired by the idea of giving back to the society. Parvaah was started with a mission to send a message with a social cause through festivals and events. Each year KJSCE undertakes social initiatives based on relevant issues in the society. Abhiyantriki having a diverse crowd and a large reach is an ideal platform for promoting social causes. It created awareness amongst the 4000+ students that attended Symphony, and thousands others in various colleges. Parvaah promises to be a platform to reach out to the mass and bring in the change.

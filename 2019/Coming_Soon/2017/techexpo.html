<h1>S-Hand:</h1>
  <div class="parent">
    <div class="content">
      A concept taken straight out of a sci-fi movie, the S-Hand is a futuristic calling device that allows the user to make and receive phone calls literally at the flick of the wrist. The device aims to simplify the process of calling by incorporating the functions of a basic cell phone onto a wearable hand glove. Basic features like the receiver and the speaker are embedded onto the glove. In conclusion, the S-Hand is an invention designed for the future but made in the present.

<h1>Staircase Climbing:</h1>
  <div class="parent">
    <div class="content">
In a world where it is mandatory for establishments to be physically-challenged friendly, ramps are an absolute necessity, but are not implemented in a majority of places. To combat this problem, Meenu Gigi has developed a prototype for a wheelchair, that is capable of climbing staircases. It is controlled using a mobile app, and can ascend as well as descend. It comes as a blessing for people stuck in places that are not friendly towards the physically challenged. Being app-controlled, it is easy to use, and thanks to its compact design, is easy to transport. If put into production, it will help solve the problems of various differently-abled individuals.

  <div class="parent">
    <div class="content">
      It is the first satellite built under the Student Satellite Program of IIT Bombay. It contains all the facilities of an actual commercial satellite and is a completely independent unit. It was launched on the 26th of September, 2016 on the PSLV-C35. Its primary purpose was to calculate the Total Electron Count (TEC) of the ionosphere.

  <h1>Water Control System:</h1>
  <div class="parent">
    <div class="content">
      The problem of intermittent water supply due to technical difficulties and human error is something that has been a constant feature in housing societies and industries alike. To counter this, budding innovators have developed a completely automated water supply system. The system can be controlled remotely using a mobile app and facilitates hassle-free management of the water supply system.

  <h1>Puzzlebox Orbit and 3-D printed Car:</h1>
  <div class="parent">
    <div class="content">
      The puzzle box orbit is a brain controlled helicopter. Yes, you heard that right! It's an open source helicopter which is manoeuvred by the brainwaves of the user. This phenomenon is achieved by the use of a device called the Neurosky Mindwave Mobile handset which shows the userâ€™s attention or meditation level.
      <br>
      Also on display, is India's first brain controlled 3D printed car which starts, stops, and accelerates with user's attention levels! The whole concept of controlling machines by the brain signals will form the bedrock of innovations in the future. This expo will definitely provide worthwhile insights into this technology.

  <h1>Multi-utility Power Generator:</h1>
  <div class="parent">
    <div class="content">
      The multi-utility power generator is an innovation which can be a model for overcoming current power crisis in our society. The generator creates the necessary power by rotation and application of pressure,  and can light a LED (Light Emitting Diode) bulb for 30-40 minutes. The striking feature of the machine is that, although it generates enough power for high-end consumption, the cost of production is meagre in comparison. Moreover, the recharging time is just 30-40 minutes. Thus, the multi-utility power generator is an efficient prototype for power generation.

      With the frenzy surrounding cars and technology related to it, it's imperative to have an expo on automobiles. Developed by a group of engineering students, these cars are efficient and are created from scratch. Each car has a unique specification, and is brilliantly designed for efficient performance. Keeping the idea of need of alternative fuel in mind, the students have developed an electric car as well. This exhibition will help one gain insights into the advancements related to automobiles.

  <h1>Underwater Surveillance Vehicle:</h1>
  <div class="parent">
    <div class="content">
      Over the years, the importance of submarines in defence and research has become paramount. With an eye on that, the Underwater Surveillance Vehicle, created by a group of four students, can be used for scientific, commercial, and military applications. The vehicle is designed by the integration of mechanical and electrical systems, and it requires autonomous guidance and control systems, in order to perform underwater tasks. Also, the submarine consists of accelerometer, magnetometer, and gyroscope for direction and orientation under water. The model will help everyone in understanding the technicalities and the intricacies  related in developing an underwater vehicle.

  <h1>Smart Sanitary Waste Management System:</h1>
  <div class="parent">
    <div class="content">
      India being a populous country, produces a large amount of waste leading to rampant garbage disposal related problems. To put an end to this atrocious practice, a group of enterprising innovators have engineered a Smart Sanitary Waste Management System aimed to resolve the issue. The E-dustbin hence implemented will alert the user when it is full, and will also notify the Municipal Corporation, which will take care of the further incineration. Since the pad is made of different kinds of plastics, its incineration leads to air pollution. Hence a bioconversion scheme will convert the gases to acetic acid, which can be further converted to power alcohol that helps in generating revenue.

      The AUV is an ambitious project of three alumni of K.J. Somaiya College of Engineering. The vehicle is capable to operate upto a depth of 20 metres, and is equipped with two cameras, a gripper arm, and a torpedo. With the assistance of visual feedback, the automated vehicle will be capable of navigation. This vehicle is designed by The Marine Robotics Team (TMRT), KJSCE, who aspire to compete in global competitions like SAUVC 2018 (Singapore Autonomous Underwater Vehicle). With a dedicated team, the TMRT have developed a robust AUV, which must be seen to believe it.
